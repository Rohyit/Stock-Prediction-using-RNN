# Stock Price Prediction using RNN

This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict stock prices. The model is built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers, which are effective for time series data like stock prices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohyit/Stock-Prediction-using-RNN.git

2. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the build_model.py script to train the model:
   python build_model.py

4. Use predict.py for making predictions on test data:
   python predict.py

Results : 
The model achieves an RMSE of 3.12 on the test data (96.85% Accuracy).
